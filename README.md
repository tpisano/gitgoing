Get going with contributing to open-source software

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://gitgoing.readthedocs.org.

## Setting up your environment

1. Make a github account
2. Install git on your computer
  * Mac
    1. Create a folder `~/code` by typing into the terminal `mkdir ~/code`
      * (feel free to use your own code folder if you already have one that you like)
    2. OPTIONAL: Use homebrew http://brew.sh (it's a great package manager for installing command line apps!)
      * Install by pasting this into your terminal: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  * Windows
    1. Install gitextensions here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/
    2. Create a folder `C:\code` by typing into powershell `mkdir C:\code`
      * (feel free to use your own code folder if you already have one that you like)
3. Install Anaconda Python distribution found here: http://continuum.io/downloads
  * Make sure to use the Python 2.7 version. You can verify that your computer has Python 2.7 by typing `python --version` into your terminal.
4. Fork this repo by clicking the `Fork` button in the top right corner on the github page for this repo: https://github.com/CodeNeuro/gitgoing
5. Clone the fork that you just made by clicking the url to clone on the right side of the github page of your fork. Then browse in your terminal to your code folder `cd ~/code` and then type in the clone command: `git clone {url_of_your_fork}`

## Let's learn Git
1. Make a change (aka edit) to a file in your cloned repo and save the change locally. Try making a change to this README.md file by adding content to the bottom of it.
2. Type `git status` in the terminal to see what's up. Type `git diff` to get a detailed list of differences. Use `j` and `k` to navigate up and down the diff, and `q` to end the diff.
3. Type `git commit -am "{message for the commit}"` to create a new commit
4. Type `git status` to see what's up.
5. Type `git push` to push your changes up to the github server.
6. If you made a change to the README.md file, you should see it changed on your fork's github page.
7. Type `git branch` to list out the current local branches
8. Type `git checkout -b {branch_name}` to create a new branch
9. Make a commit onto the branch, and push the changes up to github.
10. You should see your new branch up on your fork's github page.

## Let's make a real contribution
1. You can run the test suite by typing `py.test` (pronounced "pie test") in the repo's root directory. This is a python package that will execute the tests and print out the results.
2. Open up the test file `gitgoing/tests/test_gitgoing.py` in your favorite editor
3. Comment out the test named `test_cv_broken` by removing the # characters at the beginning of each line of the test in the `test_gitgoing.py` file.
4. Run the tests again and watch it fail. You should see this kind of message:

```

    def test_cv(x_norm):
        from gitgoing.gitgoing import std, mean, cv
    
        test_cv = cv(x_norm)
        true_cv = std(x_norm)/mean(x_norm)
    
        # This test will fail
>       assert test_cv == true_cv
E       assert 0.51026948757496537 == 1.9597487687387671

```

4. Fix the test! Run the tests again and watch it succeed.
5. Create a pull request back to the original repo that you forked by going to 
   your `gitgoing` repo website (`github.com/yourgithubusername/gitgoing`),
   and pressing the green "compare" button next to the branches, which looks 
   like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/xKzb8v7.png)
6. And that's how you contribute to open source software!

## Build the documentation
A key part of any open source project is documenting it! The [sphinx](link) library makes it really easy to add documentation to a project, which you can then host for free on [github pages](link).

We're currently doing that for this repository, you can see the documentation page [here](http://codeneuro.org/gitgoing)

To see where the documentation comes from, you can build it yourself locally. If you've cloned this repository, just navigate to the `docs` folder, and then enter

```
sphinx-build -a . build
```
This creates a set of `.html` files in the folder `build`. If you go into that folder and double-click `index.html`, it should open in a web browser, and you'll see something that looks just like the webpage mentioned above.

Sphinx takes a little bit of configuration, but can automatically genreate a page directly from your Python package, including the documentation you provide for your classes and methods. And you can regenerate the documentation whenever you change the code. This makes it easy to automatically document your project and keep the documentation up to date.
